# GBH AMS One-off Scripts

Various one-off scripts, originally from Drew's machine, for doing specific
tasks, like fixing metadata, which the AMS2 app doesn't support yet.

These scripts are typically created quickly, without automated tests or integrations
into AMS2 or anywhere else. As such, they probably require some specific knowledge
of the enviornment in which they are intended to run. And they may only be intended
to run once. So treat this repo as an archive, rather than deployable code.
